# coltsYelpCamp
This is a bootcamp project by Colt on Udemy.
It is a site where you can post a place you have visited. You can upload upto 10 pictures.
If you login to the site, you can leave a rating on other posters.

By doing this project I learned how to handle express routes and how to work with ejs.
The best part of this project is the authentication.
You will learn how to work with Helmet, passportjs, joi and how to use sessions.
As for the pictures, all uploaded pictures are stored in the cloudinary.

The demo is hosted on heroku here:
